### 1. Attendance & Punctuality
- Were you consistently present in class?
Yes, I was consistently present and attentive in class.

- Did you miss fewer than five class meetings?
Yes, I've only missed three meetings. Two of them were excused abscenses, medical and funeral service. I've missed one meeting waking up late, and another getting kicked out the meeting when my camera would not work, and I could not rejoin the meeting. I did contact Prof. Leo about this, and the two other emergency absences. 

- Did you arrive (or log in) on time â€” ideally before or by 10:25 AM?
Most meetings I arrived early, if not on time. A few meetings I would arrive 1-3 minutes late. This wasn't often, but Mondays were harder for me to join in on time.

### 2. Participation & Engagement
- Did you actively contribute to class discussions â€” either by answering questions, asking your own, or helping peers?
Yes, I've actively contributed to class discussions. I answered Prof. Leo when my name was caleld, asked questions for clarification, to avoid repeated mistakes, and made sure my completed homework was accounted for. I also help one peer find the zoom link once we switched to zoom so he could attend the class meetings.

- Did you take initiative in your learning, e.g., exploring beyond the homework or trying optional problems?
Yes, I've taken initiative in my learning with the assigned readings and challenge problems. I remember asking Prof. Leo questions on the reading material and he gave me problems to work on to make sure I understood my own question. I had questions on mid-point and merge sort from the readings that Prof. Leo answered and created additional exercises that helped me more on the recursion exercises homework.
### 3. Presence & Focus
- Were you fully mentally present during class sessions?
Yes, I was mentally present when I joined the Zoom/Team calls.

- Were you free from distractions like driving, traveling, or multitasking during Zoom classes?
Not all the time, life happens. There were a few times I had to turn my camera off due to someone being in my background, or traveling. This was not often though. I think I've had my camera off for two full class sessions (this was the last meeting week) and my camera off for a short 5 mins twice throughout the semester to fix my camera or screen since I share my computer with my siblings. I always turned it back on though. 

- Did you seek help when needed â€” e.g., attending office hours, emailing questions, or discussing challenges?
Yes, I've emailed Prof. Leo a lot throughout the course. I went to office hours once or twice. Most of my questions were answered during or after the class session ended.

### 4. Assignment Timeliness
- Did you submit your work on time and keep up with due dates?
Yes, most of my assignments that are completed were submitted on time. I have one that might be marked late by a few minutes after 5pm. This was because I forgot to add a reflection on the previous assignment, however the coding portion was done before the 5pm deadline.

### 5. Reflection & Growth
- Did you review the posted solutions thoughtfully?
I believe I have reviewed the posted solutions thoughtfully. I always wrote a lengthy reflection that required effort, critical thinking, and a detailed evalution. I always included what went well in the comparison, what looked different, what I could have changed, and things that made my code harder to understand. I am no sure if we were supposed to provide a grade for the assignmenet or not but I included that sometimes as well that helped me figure out what I needed to improve on.

- Did you compare them to your own work and reflect on improvements?
Yes! All my reflections were compared to Prof. Leo's code. I have a section of what I learned/improved on/looks different where I reflect on mistakes and growth.

- Did you follow through on those reflections in future assignments?
Yes, I tried my hardest to not repeat a mistake. I also tried my hardest to submit on time despite any personal challenges that came up for me throughout the week. I tried my hardest to grow as a coder, student, and potential employee.

### 6. Code Quality
- Did your code meet the assignment requirements?
Yes! I made sure to follow the standing requirements, programmers pact, and the readme file. Although at the beginnning I do have some assignments that break them like week 1's assignment but I did not break that same rule in the future assignments.

- Did it reflect clear logic, correct functionality, and effort to improve based on feedback?
Most likely. I do admit not all of my codes are A work and that was due to some functionality but I do know that I always had effort and clear logic throughout the semeseter. 

- Did your code comply with the [Programmer's Pact](./ProgrammerPact.pdf)? The Pact was included with nearly every assignment and was mentioned explicitly in them as a requirement.
Yes!

## ðŸ“£ Final Thoughts
I am proud of my performance this semester. I had a lot of challenges like making sure I came on time, submitting the homework by the deadline, and asking for clarification so I can avoided repeated mistakes. I navigated the challenges well by asking for help, reading materials and additional exercises and understanding which pact I broke so I would not do it again in future assignments. I am proud of only missing one assignment and that the assignements that were completed were done on time. I am proud of how vocal I was during the class meetings.
